# Information Retrieval Exercises
A set of Jupyter Notebooks for the course Information Retrieval 2016, held at Politecnicod di Milano

The first notebook
https://github.com/mbuccoli/InformationRetrievalExercises/blob/master/SVD%20and%20LSA.ipynb
includes to the code I showed in last class and concerning the use of SVD for a vector space model.

The secondo notebook
https://github.com/mbuccoli/IR2016/InformationRetrievalExercises/master/Exercizes%20quality%20metrics.ipynb
includes one exercize for the quality metrics. The script automatically generates a random query results and it is able to solve several exercizes.  

In order to use it, just download the repo, unzip it and run a jupyter notebook session from the directory of the repository.
The easiest way to install jupyter notebook is based on Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
that also installes the required libraries for the scripts (i.e., numpy, scipy and matplotlib).
Select the version for Python3.x and for your architecture. 
A lighter approach is based on MiniConda (http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), for which you will need to manually install the aforementioned packages.

Please, feel free to clone the repository and inform me if you find any bug or the solution to the exercizes doesn't seem correct to you. You can use the tools that Github provides to raise an issue and I suggest to use the issues section as a forum to possibly collaborate together.
